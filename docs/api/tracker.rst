Dialogue State Tracker
======================

The tracker stores and maintains the state of the dialogue with a single user.
It is stored in a tracker store, retrieved when incoming messages for the
conversation are received and updated after actions have been executed

Here we go:

.. automodule:: rasa_core.trackers
    :members:
    :undoc-members:
    :show-inheritance:
